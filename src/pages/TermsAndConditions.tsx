/**
 * Ported from the client's existing site, read off
 * https://www.quadishotels.com/terms-and-conditions on 30 Jul 2026. Her page is
 * indexed and would 404 after the cutover, since we move onto the same domain.
 *
 * HER TWO DOCUMENTS CONTRADICT EACH OTHER, and this needs her decision.
 *
 * These terms say advance deposits "once paid, are non-refundable unless
 * otherwise stated". The cancellation and refund policy she sent on 27 Jul —
 * live here at /cancellation-policy — gives free cancellation up to 24 hours
 * before check-in. Both cannot be true, and the difference is a real refund to
 * a real guest.
 *
 * Rather than pick one on her behalf, the Reservations section below keeps her
 * wording and adds a precedence line pointing at the cancellation policy, which
 * is the more specific and more recent of the two and the one Razorpay requires
 * to be visible. That resolves the conflict without inventing a policy. It is
 * still a change to her legal text and she has to confirm it — see AGENTS.md.

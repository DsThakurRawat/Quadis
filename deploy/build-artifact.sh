# Build the deployable artifact — and ONLY the deployable artifact.

# WHAT SHIPS, and nothing else:
#   www/            the built frontend (dist/), including public/ assets
#   api/            the compiled backend (backend/dist/) + production deps
#   nginx/          the real server config and the 63 legacy 301s
#   systemd/        the API unit, which is what sets NODE_ENV=production
#
# WHAT DOES NOT SHIP, and why it is listed explicitly rather than left to a
# .gitignore-style guess:
#   docs/           client-comms/** is internal correspondence about the client
#   .agents/        AWS account ids, instance ids, incident history
#   client-assets/  423 files including her plaintext logins
#   backend/.env    a live Groq key
#   src/ scripts/   sources; the box runs the build output, not the repo
#   .git/           the whole history, on a public web root
#
# The rule this encodes: the artifact is ASSEMBLED, never synced. A
# `rsync repo-root -> /var/www` is the single mistake that turns all of the
# above into public URLs on the client's own domain. nginx has deny rules as a
# backstop (deploy/nginx/quadis.conf) but the backstop is not the plan.

# Two reasons, both learned the hard way:
#   1. sharp ships platform- and ABI-specific native binaries (AGENTS.md 9).
#      This artifact is built on Node 22; the box runs Node 20.20.2. Copying
#      node_modules across that gap gives NODE_MODULE_VERSION errors at
#      require() time — after systemd has reported the unit "started".
#   2. It is ~85 MB of the 91 MB artifact. Building deps on the target makes
#      the upload seconds rather than minutes.
